# Custom Dark Forest Client
my combination of useful custom client modifications for power users. history is as follows:
1. originally forked from https://github.com/adietrichs/client
2. made minor changes to allow running under windows by default
3. updated to include https://github.com/phated/v06-round3-client

## Installation
1. Install latest version of Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install yarn using `npm install --global yarn` since npm is now installed since it's bundled with Node.js
3. Run `yarn` inside the `client` folder to install dependencies

## Running
1. Run `runclient.bat` to run in Windows
2. When asked you can use your whitelist key or import your mainnet burner secret and home coordinates.

## Other Stuff

I highly recommend the [df-plugin-dev-server](https://github.com/projectsophon/df-plugin-dev-server) if you're going to write your own plugins, it's quite easy to use! saves you from copy-pasting your code every time you want to update it.
